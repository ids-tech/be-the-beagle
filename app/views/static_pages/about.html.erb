<p>
This website is a personal project geared towards exploration and learning. The name comes from the name of Charles Darwin's ship, The HMS Beagle. Also, my first dog was a Beagle named Chip, and he was awesome. I hope you have fun exploring the site. If you're here checking out my programming skills, please keep in mind that this is a work in progress.

Enjoy!
